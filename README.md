# loan-default-prediction

This project is inspired by the TensorFlow 2.0 course on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk) and is intended to practice linear regression using TensorFlow. The dataset that is used for this project originates from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/loan-default-prediction).

This project attempts to predict whether a borrower is likely to default based on their employment status, bank balance and annual salary.
